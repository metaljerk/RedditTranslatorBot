# RedditTranslatorBot

Inspiration for the bot: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/l7xl35/hilfe/

Plans: use praw to crawl subreddits in the list of subreddits, pull in the self.text and use an API (probably google translate) to translate it and return the results in a comment on the post.
